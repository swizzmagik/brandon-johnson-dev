## For GitHub repositories

To fetch your latest repositories from GitHub, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access token. You can create a token by following the steps below:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Click on Developer settings
3. Click on Personal access tokens
4. Click on Generate new token
5. Give the token a name and select the scopes you want to give to the token
6. Click on Generate token
7. Copy the token and paste it in the .env file (an example already exists as `.env.example`. Create another file called `.env` and paste in the personal access token)
